The 3D printing pars are available in the `02_cad` and on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1162687/).

Parts:
- 2x connector (PLA)
- 2x front panel (PLA, white)

# Assembly
To hide the small gap between the front panels I used a big sheet of white paper and cut the display holes into it. The paper is then glued to the back of the front panel.

The font file as Affinity Designer file is available in the res directory. To convert the exported images to bitmaps you may use this [tool](https://javl.github.io/image2cpp/). Th bitmaps can be found in `01_src\include\bitmaps.h`.
